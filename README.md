## COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

### **Project Description**
This project analyzes COVID-19 case trends using datasets from the [Johns Hopkins University GitHub repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The objective is to merge two datasets—`UID_ISO_FIPS_LookUp_Table` and `time_series_covid19_confirmed_global`—to explore trends in the number of COVID-19 cases. The final analysis includes visualizations of:
- Overall change in the log-transformed number of cases over time.
- Change in log-transformed number of cases per country.
- Change in infection rate per 100,000 people over time.
